\section{Conclusion}

For now Dart should not be used for production environments, but for broadening ones horizon web developers should have a look at Dart -- have a look at the sample applications or try the playground\footnote{\url{http://www.dartlang.org/}}.

Throughout the paper Dart has shown capabilities to develop responsive web applications. Beneath a familiar syntax Dart provides object-orientation, a great collection framework, optional typing and an easy-to-use HTML library.

The remaining question is: \textbf{Will Dart be supported natively by the popular browsers?} I am sure Dart could make a great job, but it is about waiting for statements from the big browser developers whether they think about implementing support or not.
