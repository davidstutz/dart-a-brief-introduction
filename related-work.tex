\section{Related work}

Due to the early state of Dart the list of related work is limited to only a few books and a handful active blogs.

Blogs like DartWatch\footnote{\url{http://dartwatch.com/}}, Dart Vader\footnote{\url{http://dartvader.grobmeier.de/}} or dartr\footnote{\url{http://dartr.com/}} just like Seth Ladd's Blog\footnote{\url{http://blog.sethladd.com/}} who has also co-authored ``What is Dart?''\footnote{\url{http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025887.do}} have been active since the early days of Dart.

Furthermore there are two books currently in progress: ``Dart for Hipsters''\footnote{\url{http://dart4hipsters.com/toc.html}} from Chris Strom\footnote{\url{http://japhr.blogspot.de/search/label/dart}} who is also developing a Dart-based MVC Framework ``Hipster-MVC''\footnote{\url{https://github.com/eee-c/hipster-mvc}} and ``Dart in Action''\footnote{\url{http://www.manning.com/buckett/}} from Chris Buckett. They will cover both client- and server-side development with Dart in more detail.
