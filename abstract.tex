\section{Abstract}

Dart is a brand new language for client and server side web development from Google. The language provides class-based object-orientation and allows developing modular and structured applications.

For client side development Google learned from Javascript and provides an own high featured library for DOM (Document Object Model\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model}}) manipulation and event handling. This paper will introduce client side development with Dart by developing a small sample application.

Allowing server side development, too, Dart allows to create homogeneous systems covering both client and server.

% While developing a small sample application this paper shows some of Dart's features and libraries. Beneath the usage of Dart's HTML library for DOM manipulation and event handling the basic C-like syntax is introduced. Working with classes, declaring private and public attribtues and methods and working with collections is shown.

% Beneath shorthand get/set and method declarations and public/private declarations by prefx Dart will provide abstract classes and interfaces and rely on single-inheritance.

As conclusion Dart shows potential for challenging modern web development. The one question remaining for client-side development using Dart is the following: \textbf{Will the browsers implement native support for Dart} -- will Dart challenge a growing community for Javascript?
