\subsection{Development state}

Sure, Dart is currently a technical preview. Thus certain aspects of the language will not work properly and some concepts -- like abstract classes -- are not implemented yet. The language may change throughout the development process and for stability there is still some work to do.

\subsection{Browser support}

For now no browser but Dartium does support Dart natively. Meaning developed Dart applications have to be compiled to Javascript so they will work with common used browsers.

Sure for a technical preview this is ok, but unfortunately ``[as] of March 2012, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Opera Software's Opera browser, and Apple Safari do not have plans to implement support for Dart''.\cite{Wikipedia}

\subsection{Learned from Javascript}

There are some things to point out Google learned from today's web development and especially from Javascript regarding client-side development:\cite{t3n}

\begin{itemize}
\item Built-in solution for working with libraries in library scope -- no global namespace.
\item Powerful and easy-to-use HTML library based on CSS selectors (similar to JQuery).
\item Class-based object-orientation supporting abstract classes and interfaces instead of prototypes.
\item Comfortable type checking due to optional typing.
\end{itemize}
